## üåç Environmental Data

### **What We Calculate**
- **CO2 emissions per visit** based on data transfer and energy usage
- **Water usage per visit** for data center cooling and processing
- **Page size impact** measured in real-time
- **Green hosting bonus** for renewable energy-powered websites
- **AI processing overhead** with model-specific multipliers for both CO2 and water

### **Data Sources**
- **[Green Web Foundation API](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/)** - Renewable energy hosting verification
- **Real-time page analysis** - Actual data transfer measurements
- **Built-in AI detection** - Pattern matching for AI services and content

## ü§ù Contributing

### **When to Report Missing Data**
We automatically calculate most environmental data, but you can help by reporting:

- ü§ñ **Missing AI detection** - AI-powered sites we haven't identified
- üåê **Incorrect green hosting** - Wrong renewable energy status
- üìä **Unusual environmental impact** - Significantly different than calculated

### **How to Contribute**
[**Report Missing Data**](https://github.com/moralesk/greenScore_extension/issues/new?template=missing-data.yml) - Use our structured form to report detection issues

For detailed guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## üîß Technical Details

### **Architecture**
- **Single source of truth** - `green-calculator.js` handles all environmental calculations
- **Real-time APIs** - Live data from Green Web Foundation and page analysis
- **Fallback systems** - Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- **CSP compliance** - Works on all websites including those with strict security policies

### **Scoring Algorithm**
```
Base Score (0-100):
- <1g CO2: 90-100 (A+/A)
- 1-2g CO2: 80-89 (A)  
- 2-5g CO2: 70-79 (B)
- 5-10g CO2: 60-69 (C)
- 10-20g CO2: 40-59 (D)
- >20g CO2: 0-39 (F)

AI Multipliers (CO2 & Water):
- ChatGPT/GPT-4: 3.5x
- Gemini: 3.2x  
- Claude: 3.0x
- GitHub Copilot: 1.8x
- Notion AI: 1.6x

Water Usage Factors:
- Base: 1.8L per kWh
- AI Processing: 2.5x multiplier (cooling)
- Green Hosting: 30% reduction

Green Hosting Bonus: +10 points
```

## üìà Impact

Help users make informed decisions about their digital environmental footprint by providing:
- **Transparency** into website and AI service energy consumption
- **Actionable insights** for choosing more sustainable alternatives  
- **Environmental awareness** integrated into daily browsing
- **Support channels** for environmental organizations
